```pseudocode
function isConvex(p0,...,pn-1)
	for i‚Üê0 to n-1 do
		if Right(pi, p(i+1) mod n,p(i+2) mod n) then
			return false
return true
```

This algorithm can't correctly determine if P is  the boundary of a convex polygon in counter-clockwise order. By checking orientation of neighboring edges, among all points, it can detect any invalid right turn. if the orientation is collinear, the algorithm will simply skip and check the next pair of edges. 



However, It can't not handle the case when there are less than three points in P. For example, if P only has two points p1 and p2, in the first iteration where `i=0`, the three points passed into orientation function would be `p0`, `p(0+1) mod 2 = 1p`, and `p(0+2) mod 2 = p2`. The orientation of these three points is collinear. In the next iteration where `i=1`,  the points are `p1`, `p0`, and `p1`. Again, these points are collinear. After 2 iterations, the function eventually returns true as there's no right turn found among neighboring edges. Given the fact that at least three points are required to form a polygon, the output is incorrect.
